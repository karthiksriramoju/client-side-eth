# Client-Side Ethereum Learning 

## Overview
This is dedicated to learning and implementing Ethereum-related functionality on the client side using React. It includes working with the **wagmi** library, interacting with smart contracts, and handling blockchain events.

## Features
- **Ethereum Wallet Integration**: Connect wallets like MetaMask using `wagmi`.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Read and write data to smart contracts from the frontend.
- **Event Listening**: Index blockchain events and handle emitted events efficiently.
- **React-based UI**: Modern frontend built using React.

## Tech Stack
- **React** – Frontend framework
- **wagmi** – React hooks for Ethereum
- **Vite** – Build tool for fast development

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or another Ethereum wallet

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/karthiksriramoju/client-side-eth.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd client-side-eth
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
- **Connect Wallet**: Click on the "Connect Wallet" button to link MetaMask.
- **Interact with Smart Contracts**: Use the UI to read/write data from Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Catch Emitted Events**: Listen for and display blockchain events in real-time.
